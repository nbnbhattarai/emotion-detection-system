### Data Analysis

- Data for each category:

| Class   | Data Count |
|---------+------------|
| joy     |       1082 |
| sadness |       1074 |

| guilt   |       1040 |


- Data seems to be balanced
- Most of frequent words are prepositions
- Most of the Least frequent words (frequency = 1) are words with spelling mistake
